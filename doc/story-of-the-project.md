# 🌀 The Story of CineSphere

## 💼 The Client’s Dream

Once upon a late April afternoon, a passionate cinephile approached our team — Team Multi Kulti — with a vision:  
> _“I want my old 'PopcornAbend' website to become a full-fledged streaming SaaS — but built on top of my existing HTML. Please refactor it.”_

A bold request. A challenge of legacy. Naturally, we said:  
**_“Absolutely.”_**  
And so began our tale.

## 🌩️ The First Storm

We knew from Day One: rewriting would be faster. But the mission was clear — and we were honored to accept it.  
Of course, as in every classic narrative, Act I ends with a storm: criticism, chaos, and _debugging doom_.  
But where some saw setbacks, we saw opportunity.

## 🌱 From Seeds to Stories

That Thursday feedback?  
It was a gift.

> It sparked reflection, deeper ownership, and, above all, teamwork.  
> We regrouped. Rewrote. Recommitted.

The result? An application that works, inspires, and grows.

## 💡 Our Culture: Team Multi Kulti

May 12th, 2025 — the unofficial founding of Team Multi Kulti.  
Not just a dev team. A movement.

> We are global by design, united by code, bonded by crisis.  
> Our mission? Build better web experiences, with beauty and empathy.

Through async standups, Git hiccups, Tailwind triumphs, and the occasional "Friseurtermin" (bald guy priorities 🤷‍♂️), we thrived.

## 📺 CineSphere: Born From This

A modern React interface.
A touch of design delight via Tailwind and DaisyUI.
Mock backend magic with `json-server`.
And a watchlist that _actually_ watches over you.

We took a client's ambiguous legacy and reimagined it — playfully, professionally, and together.

## ✨ Epilogue

_CineSphere_ is more than a streaming SPA.  
It’s our story in code:  
Of resilience, laughter, and late-night commits.

Long live Team Multi Kulti.  
Long live collaborative learning.

> One Planet. Infinite Stories.
