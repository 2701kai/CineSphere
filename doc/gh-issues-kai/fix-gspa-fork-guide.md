# 🛠️ Git Fix Report: Repairing `GSPA` Fork for Clean Vercel Deployment

---

## 🔍 What Happened

You forked the shared group project [`Gruppenprojekt-SPA`](https://github.com/FbW-WD-24-D08/Gruppenprojekt-SPA) to your account:  
➡️ `https://github.com/2701kai/GSPA`  

Then:
- You made changes on **your fork's `main` branch** (like `.env`, hero section).
- Your local `main` branch went **2 commits ahead / 4 behind** the original (see GitHub UI).
- You tried to `git push` → got rejected (non-fast-forward).
- You ran `git pull` → got error due to divergent history (it doesn’t know how to combine upstream + your changes).

---

## 🧯 How to Fix It

### ✅ Option 1: Backup your work + reset `main` to match original upstream
(Recommended if your local changes are small or committed)

```bash
# Backup your work (just in case)
git branch backup-hero
git checkout main

# Reset your fork to match the upstream
git fetch origin
git reset --hard origin/main

# (optional) re-merge your branch:
git merge backup-hero
git push origin main --force
```

Then **re-deploy to Vercel**, it will use the cleaned `main`.

### 💡 Option 2: Merge upstream + keep your changes (if both are large)

```bash
# Set upstream to the original group repo
git remote add upstream https://github.com/FbW-WD-24-D08/Gruppenprojekt-SPA.git
git fetch upstream

# Merge changes into your fork’s main
git checkout main
git merge upstream/main

# If conflicts appear, fix them
git push origin main
```

## 🚀 Vercel Deployment Tip

Your Vercel deployment is set to `main`. After fixing, you can:
- Push to `main` normally
- Or re-deploy from dashboard if auto-deploy doesn’t trigger

---

## ✅ Final Result Should Look Like:

- GitHub repo clean ✅
- App looks like the "One Planet. Infinite Stories" preview ✅
- Logo, button, font, layout all intact ✅
